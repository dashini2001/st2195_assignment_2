The task for Assignment is to scrape the table about cars from the [CSV wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) and to convert the html table to CSV and then save it into the local folder.

This has to be done for both R and Python.

For R, I used rvest to scrape the data and for Python, I used Pandas to scrape the data.
